# Dawn Chorus

Dawn Chorus is an open-source project focused on developing firmware and hardware for variometers based on HAL STM32. Our mission is to provide accessible tools for the paragliding and aviation communities while fostering collaboration and innovation through open-source principles.

## Key Features
- **Open-Source Firmware:** Built with HAL STM32 and licensed under GPLv3.
- **Custom Hardware:** Blueprints and design files to create your own variometer.
- **Modular Ecosystem:** Easily extend and customize for various use cases.

## How It Works
1. Clone the repository and build the firmware using STM32CubeIDE or your preferred environment.
2. Assemble the hardware using provided blueprints and schematics.
3. Flash the firmware onto your STM32 microcontroller.
4. Enjoy precise altitude and vertical speed readings.

## Monetization Strategy
Dawn Chorus is open-source under the GPLv3 license, allowing anyone to build and use the project freely. For professional assembly, extended support, and ecosystem integration, we offer:
- Turnkey project assembly.
- Technical support and troubleshooting.
- Premium services for customization and integration.
