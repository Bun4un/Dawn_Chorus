# Dawn_Chorus
Firmware for a variometer built on STM32 using HAL library. Measures vertical speed and altitude changes, ideal for paragliding or gliding. Features sensor integration (e.g., barometers), real-time data processing, and low-power design. Supports customization and future Bluetooth/display extensions.


Features:

    []Vertical speed measurement (climb/sink rate).
    []Altitude tracking and logging.
    []Real-time data processing with precise calculations.
    []Support for various sensors (e.g., barometers, IMUs).
    []Configurable parameters for user-specific requirements.
    []Low-power optimization for battery-powered operation.
